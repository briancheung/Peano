# Peano
Peano - Parameterize thEANO

A minimalist library providing tools which complement theano. The goal is to 
augment theano with functions which also happen to have trainable parameters.

We draw inspiration from these libraries:

[Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)
[Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne)
[Blocks](https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks)

Unlike the above libararies, Peano is not a standalone framework. It is meant 
to augment/extend the functionality of an already existing codebase.
